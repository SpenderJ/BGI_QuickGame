# BGI_QuickGame
Game using BGI lib in C

Little game coded in C using the graphic.h header with the Borland Graphics Interface.

What is this game.

The goal of this game zhich could be called "traffic lights game". Is to click as fast as possible on 'q' or 'y' whenever the green light appears. You'll get a score at the end depending on how many time you spent between the moment where the light became green and when you clicked. The shirtest your score is the quicker you are.

I recommand you compiling with gcc on codeblocks with the BGI lib added and the graphics.h header added too.

A version for visual studio code working is going to be pushed soon.

If you want to test our project, you just have to

Compil

And Run it.

A time out has been added to the game.
